# VerticalCurveCalculator
This program calculates the minimum length of a vertical curve in a highway given certain parameters, as asked to calculate in Transportation Engineering capstone class.



*PLEASE NOTE* - this was created in my first couple of months of learning how to program, I hacked it together as quickly as I could. There are many things I could do to improve the functionality and maintainability of this project by:
- Modularizing the the project into different directories or at the very least files. This would abstract a lot of the complexity away the poor soul trying to revisit/maintain the project.
- Remove wildcard imports.
- I'm pretty sure there is a try except pass somewhere in there.
- A lot of this, at least the GUI, would be better served as a class in more of an object-oriented design pattern
